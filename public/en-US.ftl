        Hello { $disabilityCoordinatorName },

        My name is { $senderName }. I am a blind student enrolled on campus.

        Since the COVID pandemic, many classes are now being held online through platforms like Zoom. But there has been one problem for students using a screen reader. The instructor's slide shows are completely inaccessible when screen shared in Zoom.

        But, I've located a solution. An accessibility product which displays shared slide shows in WCAG2.1 compliant HTML. The product is called, { -product-name }.

        ## For me as a student, { -product-name } will allow me to:

        - Access content real-time within a shared slide show using my screen reader.
        - Convert class materials to a number of accessible formats including braille and large print.
        - Independently review content at the same time as my classmates.
        - Absorb material according to my learning style needs.
        - Feel I'm included as an equal member of the class.
        - View the presentation material in sync with the rest of the class.
        - Not be limited to only what I hear spoken in the session.
        - Make it easier to maintain, or improve, my grade point average.

        ## For the instructor { -product-name } will:

        - Be a simple 5-minute upload.
        - Remove one more barrier to making content accessible.
        - Make the presentation available by pasting one link in chat.
        - Prevent them from having to read material out loud for me.
        - Allows a smoother accessible flow of the class.

        You can find more information about { -product-name } at { -product-link }

        After you've had a chance to look at { -product-name }, I would like to schedule a time to discuss this in more detail with you. I think { -product-name } is a reasonable accessibility accommodation for a problem with no solution until now.

        Respectfully,

        Hello { $teacherName },

        Since classes have moved online, I know there have been some challenges. But thank you so much for meeting them and making the education for our children the best it can be, under the conditions. To that end, last time we talked about { $childName }'s progress in class, I wasn't aware of the below accessibility tool.

        As you're likely aware by now, any slide presentation you share using Zoom's screen share option has been inaccessible to { $childName }'s screen reader or magnifier. I've researched it on my own and found a solution: an accessibility product which will automatically display your shared slide shows in accessible HTML.

        The product is called, { -product-name }.

        ## { -product-name } will allow { $childName } to:

        - Access content real-time within a shared slide show using { $gender ->
            [male] his
            [female] her
           *[other] their
        } screen reader or magnifier.
        - Convert class materials to a number of accessible formats including braille and large print.
        - Independently review content at the same time as { $gender ->
            [male] his
            [female] her
           *[other] their
        } classmates.
        - Absorb material according to { $gender ->
            [male] his
            [female] her
           *[other] their
        } learning style needs.
        - Feel fully included in class again.
        - Participate equally with { $gender ->
            [male] his
            [female] her
           *[other] their
        } peers.
        - View the presentation material in sync with { $gender ->
            [male] his
            [female] her
           *[other] their
        } peers.
        - Not be limited to only material covered audibly in class.
        - Improve { $gender ->
            [male] his
            [female] her
           *[other] their
        } quality of online education.

        ## For you, { -product-name } will:

        - Be a simple 5-minute upload.
        - Remove one more barrier to making content accessible.
        - Make the presentation available by pasting one link in chat.
        - Prevent you from having to redundantly read material out loud.
        - Allow a smoother accessible flow of the class for everyone.

        You can find more information about { -product-name } at { -product-link}

        After you've had a chance to look at { -product-name }, I'd like to schedule a time we could discuss how the school can obtain a license for it.

        I believe { -product-name } qualifies as a reasonable accessibility accommodation. It's also not cost prohibitive.

        Thank you, and I look forward to talking to you.

        Sincerely,

        Hello { $supervisorName },

        Adopting Zoom in our workflow has led to several productivity benefits. It's been great for our team meetings, snapshot updates, and project collaboration sessions.

        To refresh your memory, as a blind team member, I use a screen reader to complete my workload. Just recently, I've found a solution to an accessibility challenge I've had within Zoom's screen share feature.

        When presenters share slide content at our meetings within Zoom, it hasn't been accessible to my screen reader or magnification software. The great news is I've found a product which now makes screen shared slide decks completely accessible with WCAG2.1 compliant HTML. Basically, my screen reader will be able to let me read shared slide content.

        The product is called, { -product-name }.

        ## { -product-name } will allow me to:

        - Access project content in real-time within a shared slide show using my screen reader or screen magnification.
        - Convert project materials to several accessible formats, including braille and large print.
        - Independently review shared material in synch with my team.
        - Process and problem solve according to my optimum method of information input.
        - Engage more proactively real-time with my team.
        - Review material as needed, not relying solely on what is spoken in the meetings.
        - Improve productivity.

        ## For the team leader or presenter { -product-name } will:

        - Be a simple 5-minute upload.
        - Make the presentation available to me by pasting one link in chat.
        - Prevent the presenter from repeating material out loud.
        - Allow a smoother accessible flow of the meeting.
        - Remove one more barrier to making content accessible.

        There is more information about { -product-name } at { -product-link }

        { -product-name } is a simple and reasonable accessibility accommodation which is not cost prohibitive. Can you scan and review the information about { -product-name } as soon as convenient? I'd like to schedule a time with you to discuss this in more detail.

        But, I've had one challenge. As a blind person, I use what is called a screen reader to read my computer screen. The challenge is, my screen reader hasn't been able to read the words to the songs, church announcements, or scriptural reference slides you and other teachers share in Zoom.

        ## As a congregational member, { -product-name } will allow me to:

        - Independently read reference material during the service or study groups in synch with the congregation.

        - Only be a simple 5-minute upload.
        - Remove one more barrier to making content accessible to blind congregational members.
        - Make the reference material available by pasting one simple link in chat.

        - Participate equally in real-time with other members.
        - Review material as needed, not relying solely on what is spoken in the meetings.
        - Get the most from my membership.

        ## For you, { -product-name } will:

        - Be a simple 5-minute upload.
        - Make the presentation available to me by simply pasting one link in chat.
        - Prevent the presenter from repeating material out loud.
        - Remove one more barrier to making content accessible to members.

        There is more information about { -product-name } at { -product-link }

        I'd be happy to participate in a sample session with you, or have the opportunity to discuss in detail how this will positively impact my membership and others using screen reader or magnification software.

        I think { -product-name } is a simple and reasonable accessibility accommodation.

        Sincerely,  
        { $senderName }

        Hello { $eventCoordinatorName },

        My name is { $senderName }. I'm really excited about attending the upcoming { $eventName }. But, I'm writing with an accessibility concern.

        As a blind individual, I use screen reading or magnification software on my computer. Until now, content displayed through Zoom's screen shares has been inaccessible to screen readers and magnifying software.

        There's now an extremely affordable and simple product organizations can use to make shared slide decks completely accessible with WCAG2.1 compliant HTML. Basically, my screen reader will be able to let me read shared slide content.

        The product is called, { -product-name }.

        ## { -product-name } will allow me to:

        - Access event content real-time within a shared slide show using my screen reader or screen magnification.
        - Convert supplemental event materials to a number of accessible formats including braille and large print.
        - Independently review shared material in synch with others.
        - Participate fully in real-time during the live event.
        - Review material as needed, not relying solely on what is spoken in the sessions.

        ## For you, { -product-name } will:

        - Be a simple 5-minute upload.
        - Make the presentation available to me by pasting one link in chat.
        - Prevent the presenter from repeating material out loud.
        - Let you be less conscious about accessibility concerns.

        There is more information about { -product-name } at { -product-link }

        Would you review the information about { -product-name } before the event? I'd be happy to make time in my schedule to discuss this in more detail, and the positive effect it will have for me during the event.

        I think you'll agree, { -product-name } is a pretty reasonable accessibility accommodation. Plus, it is not cost prohibitive.

        Respectfully,  
        { $senderName }

    # Scribe for Meetings Self-Advocacy Kit

    Scribe for Meetings is the first service to allow online webinar and meeting presenters to share accessible slide content with print disabled participants.

    If you want more information, [click here for our Scribe for Meetings page.](https://pneumasolutions.com/products/scribe-for-meetings/)

    ## Sometimes, self-advocacy is the answer.

    When it comes to accessibility, those who are in need of it for themselves, or on behalf of another, aren't strangers to jumping in with self-advocacy to achieve it.

    We understand, and we're here to help. Especially when it comes to accessible screen shares on Zoom.

    ## How are we helping you advocate for Scribe for Meetings?

    We've assembled a Self-Advocacy Kit (SAK). A packet of e-mail formatted letters you can send to appropriate individuals on behalf of yourself, a child, or an employee.

    ## Accessibility isn't a favor, it's a right to inclusivity.

    There are obviously many different situations where you may need a presenter to provide Scribe for Meetings, but we've given you a broad range of letters to choose from.

    The below Scribe for Meetings SAK letters are ready to customize and send. Just pick the letter that fits your situation, fill in a few simple fields, copy and paste into your email app, and edit the letter as you see fit. Then send it to the desired individual in charge of hosting the meeting or webinar.

    We've also optimized a range of subject lines for each letter. This will help get your e-mail opened. Of course, you're also free to ignore our suggested subject lines and write your own.
